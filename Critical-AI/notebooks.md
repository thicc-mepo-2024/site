## Part 3: Introduction to Understanding LLM Chatbot Behavior with Document Context(no prompts)

This notebook is designed to explore the behavior and responses of an LLM chatbot when it uses document context without additional prompts. By loading a document for context, the chatbot can provide more informed and contextually relevant answers, helping you understand how AI can assist in specific, document-based queries.
