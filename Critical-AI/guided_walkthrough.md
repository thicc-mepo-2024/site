# Understanding Large Language Models in Engineering: A Critical Perspective with LLaMA2 on Hugging Face 

## Background 

In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as a revolutionary tool in the realm of artificial intelligence, capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on the vast amounts of data they are trained on. Among these, the LLaMA2 model on Hugging Face represents a significant advancement, offering engineers and researchers the ability to interact with a powerful generative AI system. 

## Understanding Large Language Models 

Large Language Models, or LLMs, are AI systems trained on extensive datasets to learn the patterns and structures of human language. These models, such as LLaMA2, are designed to respond to prompts by generating text that closely resembles human writing. The process involves analyzing the input context and generating coherent and contextually relevant responses. This capability makes LLMs invaluable tools in fields ranging from customer support to creative writing. 

## The Importance of Critical Engagement 

While LLMs present exciting possibilities, it is crucial for engineers and users to engage with these tools critically. The introduction of AI systems into various domains necessitates asking essential questions about their purpose, limitations, and ethical implications: 

- "What does 'AI' mean in this context?" 
    Understanding the specific applications and capabilities of an AI system is vital. LLMs like LLaMA2 are designed for language-related tasks, but their use in other contexts may be limited. 

- "What are the limits of the use of a particular AI system in this context?" 
    Each AI system has its boundaries, and recognizing these limitations helps prevent overreliance or misuse. LLMs, for instance, may struggle with tasks requiring deep understanding or nuanced reasoning. 

- "What knowledge or information does the AI system use, or what data was used to train the AI system" 
    Transparency in the data and methods used to train AI models is essential for evaluating their biases and potential impacts on decision-making processes. 

## The Challenge Ahead 

As engineers, you can choose the AI systems you use and how you employ them. The LLaMA2 model on Hugging Face is one such tool that allows for exploration and experimentation. However, it also poses the challenge of understanding its inner workings, capabilities, and limitations. 

This design challenge exercise invites you to delve into the complexities of LLMs, encouraging you to question, analyze, and tinker with the system to gain a deeper understanding. By doing so, you will not only enhance your technical skills but also develop a critical perspective on the responsible use of AI systems.

### Prepping for the Design Challenge  

Participants should familiarize themselves with LLaMA2 and Hugging Face Spaces. Review the documentation to understand how to deploy and interact with models in a cloud-based environment. Setting up a Hugging Face Space is crucial for running the LLaMA2 model. Understanding AI ethics and bias is essential. Participants should also become familiar with the prompt structure used in this exercise and keep a record of reflections and observations. Finally, be prepared to compare the model's outputs at different stages to assess how the inclusion of context and prompts affects the quality of the generated responses. 

## Prompts 

In this walkthrough, we will examine how LLaMA2, a Large Language Model (LLM), responds to a series of prompts with varying levels of context. The exercise involves different stages of interaction with the LLM, including prompts without context, prompts with a document, and prompts with an system prompt and a document.
